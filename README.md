# Dartomite
## General
This project is a test project as I build APIs in several different frameworks to determine what I most prefer these days. The landscape of backend frameworks has changed dramatically over the last few years since I last dug in to them. I have one other project I am going to build at the moment that will mirror this one called [Denomite](https://github.com/hammonjj/denomite)

This project is a fully-featured, self-contained admin panel built with Dart. It provides user management functionality. Designed to be lightweight and flexible, this project can be used for both personal and commercial purposes with proper attribution.

Key features include:
- User management (create, update, delete users)
- Admin interface to manage users
- Modular and scalable architecture

License: MIT (Commercial use allowed with attribution)

## Commands
- Run debug server: `dart_frog dev`
- Generate files (mocks, translations, response objects, etc.): `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## Random Notes
If after changing something in the models or DTOs Drift start complaining, run `make clean` and `make init`
